### Problem 1

#### Read in the data

``` r
data("instacart")

instacart = 
  instacart %>% 
  as_tibble(instacart)
```

#### Answer questions about the data

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns, with each row
resprenting a single product from an instacart order. Variables include
identifiers for user, order, and product; the order in which each
product was added to the cart. There are several order-level variables,
describing the day and time of the order, and number of days since prior
order. Then there are several item-specific variables, describing the
product name (e.g. Yogurt, Avocado), department (e.g. dairy and eggs,
produce), and aisle (e.g. yogurt, fresh fruits), and whether the item
has been ordered by this user in the past. In total, there are 39123
products found in 131209 orders from 131209 distinct users.

Below is a table summarizing the number of items ordered from aisle. In
total, there are 134 aisles, with fresh vegetables and fresh fruits
holding the most items ordered by far.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

Next is a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle.
Here, aisles are ordered by ascending number of items.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_yy3297_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="90%" />

Our next table shows the three most popular items in aisles
`baking ingredients`, `dog food care`, and `packaged vegetables fruits`,
and includes the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(rank < 4) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                  |    n | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|-----:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |

Finally is a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week. This
table has been formatted in an untidy manner for human readers. Pink
Lady Apples are generally purchased slightly earlier in the day than
Coffee Ice Cream, with the exception of day 5.

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  spread(key = order_dow, value = mean_hour) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

### Problem 2

#### Import and Clean the data

First, load and clean the accelerometer data set named as “accel_data”.
In this step, we will rename the variables with more clear and
meaningful titles, and also we will add in the weekend/weekday variables
into the data frame.

``` r
accel_data_df = 
  read_csv("p8105_hw3_data/accel_data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = activity_1 : activity_1440,
    names_to = 'activity_time_course_number',
    values_to = 'activity_counts'
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    day_type = ifelse (day == 'Saturday' |day == 'Sunday', "Weekend", "Weekday"),
    activity_time_course_number = as.numeric(substring(activity_time_course_number, 10)),
    activity_counts = as.numeric(activity_counts)
  ) %>%
  select(week, day_id, day, day_type, everything())
```

    ## Rows: 35 Columns: 1443
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr    (1): day
    ## dbl (1442): week, day_id, activity.1, activity.2, activity.3, activity.4, ac...
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
accel_data_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 50,400 × 6
    ##     week day_id day    day_type activity_time_course_number activity_counts
    ##    <dbl>  <dbl> <chr>  <chr>                          <dbl>           <dbl>
    ##  1     1      1 Friday Weekday                            1            88.4
    ##  2     1      1 Friday Weekday                            2            82.2
    ##  3     1      1 Friday Weekday                            3            64.4
    ##  4     1      1 Friday Weekday                            4            70.0
    ##  5     1      1 Friday Weekday                            5            75.0
    ##  6     1      1 Friday Weekday                            6            66.3
    ##  7     1      1 Friday Weekday                            7            53.8
    ##  8     1      1 Friday Weekday                            8            47.8
    ##  9     1      1 Friday Weekday                            9            55.5
    ## 10     1      1 Friday Weekday                           10            43.0
    ## # … with 50,390 more rows

This data set contains 50400 rows and 6 columns, with each row
representing the activity counts recorded on the accelerometer during an
one-minute time interval on a specific day for a 63 year-old male with
BMI 25. Variables include week, day_id, day, day_type,
activity_time_course_number, activity_counts. The ‘week’ variable is an
order-level variable indicating the week number over the 5 testing
weeks. The ‘day_id’ is also an order-level variable describing the nth
day for data collection. The ‘day’ variable suggests on which day the
data is collected. The ‘day_type’ variable describes whether the data
collection day is a weekday or during the weekend. The
‘activity_time_course_number’ suggests the nth one-minute interval in a
day for the data collection. The ‘activity_counts’ is a continuous
variable suggesting the number of counts recorded by accelerometer.

#### Create a new table

Then, create a new table by aggregating across minutes to create a total
activity variable for each day.

``` r
accel_data_df %>% 
  group_by (day_id, day, day_type) %>% 
  summarize(activity_daily_counts = sum(activity_counts)) %>% 
  arrange(activity_daily_counts) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'day_id', 'day'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| day_id | day       | day_type | activity_daily_counts |
|-------:|:----------|:---------|----------------------:|
|     24 | Saturday  | Weekend  |               1440.00 |
|     31 | Saturday  | Weekend  |               1440.00 |
|      2 | Monday    | Weekday  |              78828.07 |

|      5 | Thursday  | Weekday  |             355923.64 |
|     34 | Tuesday   | Weekday  |             367824.00 |

|     30 | Monday    | Weekday  |             389080.00 |
|     23 | Monday    | Weekday  |             409450.00 |
|     11 | Sunday    | Weekend  |             422018.00 |
|     13 | Tuesday   | Weekday  |             423245.00 |
|     28 | Wednesday | Weekday  |             434460.00 |
|     14 | Wednesday | Weekday  |             440962.00 |
|     35 | Wednesday | Weekday  |             445366.00 |
|     18 | Sunday    | Weekend  |             467052.00 |
|     15 | Friday    | Weekday  |             467420.00 |
|     21 | Wednesday | Weekday  |             468869.00 |
|     12 | Thursday  | Weekday  |             474048.00 |
|      1 | Friday    | Weekday  |             480542.62 |
|     33 | Thursday  | Weekday  |             549658.00 |
|      8 | Friday    | Weekday  |             568839.00 |
|     10 | Saturday  | Weekend  |             607175.00 |
|     29 | Friday    | Weekday  |             620860.00 |
|      4 | Sunday    | Weekend  |             631105.00 |
|     16 | Monday    | Weekday  |             685910.00 |

As for an apparent trend, only based on the table numbers, I think it is
a bit hard to observe one. While I can make a guess after arranging the
activity daily counts from the lowest to the highest. As we see, among
the top 10 daily counts, the Wednesdays’ counts occupied four places.
And the two lowest counts among the five weeks come from Saturdays’ data
collection. Thus, maybe the activity daily counts will reach a lower
level during the weekend, and will increase to a higher level during the
weekdays.

#### Make a Plot

Next, make a single-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time
courses for each day and use color to indicate day of the week.

``` r
accel_data_df %>%
  group_by(day_id, day, activity_time_course_number) %>%
  summarize(activity_interval_counts = sum(activity_counts)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = activity_time_course_number, y = activity_interval_counts, color = day)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1440, by = 180)) +
  labs(
    title = "Accelerometer Data by 24-Hour Activity Time Courses for Each Day",
    x = "Minute Interval in a Day",
    y = "Activity Counts"
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'day_id', 'day'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.
    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

<img src="p8105_hw3_yy3297_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="90%" />

#### Patterns and Conclusions:

From the plot above, we noticed that each day in a week shares a similar
dynamic pattern to a large extent. The activity counts remain at the
lowest level in the midnight (1st to 180th minute-intervals, which
suggests 00:00 am - 03:00 am). Next, the activity counts starts to
increase rapidly from 180th to 540th minute intervals (which suggests
03:00 am - 9:00 am). Then, the activity counts remain at a relatively
stable and high level until 1170th minute-interval(which suggests 7:30
pm). The activity accounts then begin to show a great up or down
fluctuations until the midnight (1440th minute-interval) and eventually
back to the lowest level. The activity count trend varies a little from
day to day in a week. There are a few highlights: 1. On Sunday, the
activity counts reach an outstanding higher level at around 630th
minute-interval(10:30 am); 2. At around 1260th minute-interval (which
suggests 9:00 pm), the activity counts will reach a very high level
above the average on Friday, but will reach a very low level below the
average on Tuesday and Sunday.

### Problem 3
